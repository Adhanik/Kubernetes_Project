IAM User and Credentials
IAM User with Administrator Access:

The IAM user with Administrator access allows Terraform to create and manage AWS resources, including EC2 instances, security groups, VPCs, etc.
The credentials you downloaded for this IAM user are stored in the .aws/credentials file, which Terraform uses to authenticate with AWS.
