When you specify `ip_protocol = "-1"` in AWS security group rules, it means that the rule applies to all IP protocols. This setting allows or denies traffic for every possible IP protocol that could be used. Here's a breakdown of what this encompasses:

### Common IP Protocols

1. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) - `tcp`:** 
   - A connection-oriented protocol used for reliable data transmission between network devices.
   - Common ports: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), SSH (22), FTP (21), and SMTP (25).

2. **UDP (User Datagram Protocol) - `udp`:**
   - A connectionless protocol used for fast data transmission without guarantee of delivery.
   - Common ports: DNS (53), DHCP (67, 68), SNMP (161), and TFTP (69).

3. **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) - `icmp`:**
   - Used for sending error messages and operational information.
   - Commonly used for ping operations (Echo Request and Echo Reply).

4. **IPv6 ICMP - `icmpv6`:**
   - Used for sending error messages and operational information in IPv6 networks.
   - Similar functions to ICMP but for IPv6.

### Other Protocols

While TCP, UDP, and ICMP are the most commonly used protocols, there are other IP protocols included under "all protocols" as well:

5. **GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) - `gre`:**
   - Protocol used for encapsulating packets in point-to-point connections.

6. **ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) - `50`:**
   - Part of the IPsec suite, used for securing data in IP networks.

7. **AH (Authentication Header) - `51`:**
   - Another part of the IPsec suite, used for authentication of IP packets.

8. **IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) - `2`:**
   - Used by IP hosts to report their multicast group memberships to routers.

9. **SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) - `sctp`:**
   - A transport layer protocol used for message-oriented communication.

### Example Protocol Numbers

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains a comprehensive list of IP protocol numbers. Here are a few examples:

- **1:** ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
- **2:** IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)
- **6:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- **17:** UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- **41:** IPv6 encapsulation
- **47:** GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation)
- **50:** ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)
- **51:** AH (Authentication Header)
- **58:** ICMPv6
- **132:** SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)

### Applying All Protocols in AWS Security Groups

By specifying `ip_protocol = "-1"`, you are essentially saying that the rule should not be limited to a specific protocol, and it will match any traffic, regardless of the IP protocol being used.

### Full Example Configuration to Allow All Traffic

Hereâ€™s how you can set up a security group rule in Terraform to allow all inbound traffic using `ip_protocol = "-1"`:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_security_group" "allow_all" {
  name        = "allow_all"
  description = "Security group that allows all traffic"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id
}

resource "aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule" "allow_all" {
  security_group_id = aws_security_group.allow_all.id
  cidr_ipv4         = "0.0.0.0/0"
  ip_protocol       = "-1"  # All protocols
}

resource "aws_instance" "ec2_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-06c68f701d8090592"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  count         = 2

  key_name = "my-key-pair"  # Replace with your key pair name

  tags = {
    Name = "instance-${count.index}"
  }

  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.allow_all.id]
}

output "public_ips" {
  value = [for instance in aws_instance.ec2_instance : instance.public_ip]
}
```

This configuration sets up a security group that allows all inbound traffic for all protocols and ports, providing complete access to your EC2 instances.
