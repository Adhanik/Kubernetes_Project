# Concept of element, how its used, why its used, syntax and all

The `element` function in Terraform is used to retrieve a single element from a list by its index. This is useful when you want to iterate over a list and access its elements in a specific order.

### Understanding the `element` Function

**Syntax:**
```hcl
element(list, index)
```

- **list**: The list from which you want to retrieve an element.
- **index**: The index of the element you want to retrieve from the list.

The `element` function helps to manage cases where you have a list of items and you need to access them in a controlled, indexed manner. This can be particularly useful in scenarios like creating resources in different availability zones.

### How `element` is Used in Your Example

In your example, the `element` function is used to assign the `availability_zone` for each `aws_ebs_volume` resource from a list of availability zones associated with the EC2 instances.

### Breakdown of Your Code

```hcl
resource "aws_ebs_volume" "myebs" {
  count             = 2
  availability_zone = element(aws_instance.ec2_instance.*.availability_zone, count.index)
  size              = 30

  tags = {
    Name = "HelloWorld-${count.index}"
  }
}
```

1. **`count = 2`**: This means you are creating 2 EBS volumes.
2. **`availability_zone`**:
   - **`aws_instance.ec2_instance.*.availability_zone`**: This is a list of availability zones where your EC2 instances are located.
   - **`element(aws_instance.ec2_instance.*.availability_zone, count.index)`**: The `element` function takes this list of availability zones and the current index (`count.index`) to select the availability zone for each EBS volume. For `count.index = 0`, it will take the first availability zone, and for `count.index = 1`, it will take the second one.
3. **`size = 30`**: Specifies the size of each EBS volume as 30 GB.
4. **`tags`**:
   - **`Name = "HelloWorld-${count.index}"`**: Tags each EBS volume with a unique name, such as `HelloWorld-0` and `HelloWorld-1`.

### Why `element` is Used

The `element` function ensures that each EBS volume is created in the corresponding availability zone of the EC2 instances. This is particularly important for maintaining high availability and ensuring that resources are properly distributed across different availability zones.

### Example Usage

To illustrate further, consider you have the following list of availability zones for your EC2 instances:
```hcl
aws_instance.ec2_instance.*.availability_zone = ["us-west-1a", "us-west-1b"]
```

With `count = 2`, the `element` function will be called twice:

- For `count.index = 0`, it will return `us-west-1a`.
- For `count.index = 1`, it will return `us-west-1b`.

This ensures that each EBS volume is associated with the correct availability zone from the list.

By using `element`, you can dynamically assign values from a list based on the index, allowing for more flexible and scalable configurations.
