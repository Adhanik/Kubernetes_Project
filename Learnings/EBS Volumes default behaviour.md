# once i created the ebs volume, i thought the one that are attached by default, would be deleted as well. but after i recreated the instance, new ebs volumes attached to EC2 instnace, i see that the old EC2 instances ebs are still there, and attached to EC2

/dev/xvda (attached)

When you recreate an EC2 instance in AWS, the behavior of attached EBS volumes depends on how the instance was recreated and whether you explicitly managed the volumes or relied on default behavior. Here’s a breakdown of what might have happened in your case:

### Default EBS Volume Behavior

1. **Recreating an EC2 Instance**:
   - When you recreate an EC2 instance, if you don't explicitly manage the existing EBS volumes (such as deleting them or detaching them from the instance), AWS will typically preserve the attached EBS volumes.

2. **EBS Volume Persistence**:
   - By default, EBS volumes that were attached to an instance are not deleted automatically when the instance is terminated or stopped. This is a safety measure to prevent accidental data loss.

3. **Reattachment on Instance Recreation**:
   - When you recreate an EC2 instance, AWS doesn't assume that you want to delete or detach existing volumes unless you specify otherwise. Therefore, the old EBS volumes that were previously attached (like `/dev/xvda`) may still be attached to the new instance if they weren't explicitly managed.

### Managing EBS Volumes in Terraform

If you want to ensure that old EBS volumes are detached or deleted when recreating instances using Terraform, you can explicitly manage them in your configuration. Here’s how you can approach it:

#### 1. Detaching Volumes (Before Termination)

Before terminating or stopping an instance, you can use Terraform to detach the volumes:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  // other configuration

  lifecycle {
    pre_destroy {
      for_each = aws_instance.example.block_device_mappings

      # Detach EBS volumes before instance termination
      execute_command = "aws ec2 detach-volume --volume-id ${each.value.ebs_volume_id}"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Deleting Volumes (After Detachment)

After detaching the volumes, you can also delete them if needed:

```hcl
resource "aws_ebs_volume" "old_ebs" {
  count = length(aws_instance.example.block_device_mappings)

  # Volume configuration
}

resource "null_resource" "delete_old_ebs" {
  count = length(aws_instance.example.block_device_mappings)

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "aws ec2 delete-volume --volume-id ${aws_ebs_volume.old_ebs.*.id[count.index]}"
  }
}
```

### Considerations

- **Data Safety**: Always ensure you have backed up any important data before detaching or deleting EBS volumes.
  
- **Terraform State**: Terraform will try to reconcile the desired state with the actual state based on its state file. Ensure you understand how Terraform manages resources and state to avoid unintended deletions or changes.

By explicitly managing EBS volumes in your Terraform configuration, you can ensure that old volumes are appropriately handled when recreating instances, avoiding unexpected attachments of old volumes to new instances.
